# Website-Template-of-Pneumonic-Lungs-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-
Contains the template of the website of Pneumonic-Lungs-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray with deeplearning. We have implemented our model on a website so that anyone from anywhere in the world can check their chest X-Rays for having pneumonia. We have made our website as simple as possible so that it becomes very easy to understand how to use this model and Check the results coming from our model. we hope our web app version of this model will help everyone for a quick decision to check the chances of having pneumonia for the lung patients. his repository contains the Template of that website.

</br>

  
 - Step 3

<p>After the selection of your image, you will able to see that your selected image has appeared on our website. Now you will able to see there is a predict button just below your selected image. The button will allow uploading the image to our server so that our model can process your image and take its decision whether your chest X-Ray image is normal or it has a chance of having pneumonia. in some cases, you may wait for a bit longer as our system is processing your image so that it can give you the perfect result from its side.</p>

</br>


- Step 4

<p>
  After some time you will able to see our model has analyzed your image and provided its result just below your uploaded image. Though it is a completely automated process and does not require any doctor to make a decision whether the uploaded image affected by pneumonia or a normal one, we strongly recommend That before taking any further decision one should consult any doctor.</p>
