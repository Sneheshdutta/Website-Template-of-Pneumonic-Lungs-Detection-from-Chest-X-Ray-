Contains the template of the website of Pneumonic-Lungs-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray with deeplearning. We have implemented our model on a website so that anyone from anywhere in the world can check their chest X-Rays for having pneumonia. We have made our website as simple as possible so that it becomes very easy to understand how to use this model and Check the results coming from our model. we hope our web app version of this model will help everyone for a quick decision to check the chances of having pneumonia for the lung patients. his repository contains the Template of that website.
